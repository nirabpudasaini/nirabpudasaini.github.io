title: Shaking Off The Rust (Getting Back into Android Programming)
---

It has been quite a long time since I last wrote some code. Recently, with some free time on my hands, I started exploring online resources to get back into coding. As I had primarily worked as an Android developer, I naturally wanted to shake off the rust and dive back into creating Android apps after more than six years. Unsurprisingly, I found that the Android development ecosystem and the broader mobile development landscape have undergone significant changes during this time. Through this blog, I aim to document my reskilling journey. I hope it serves as a useful resource for others who might be interested in getting into Android development. 

## React Native vs Flutter vs Kotlin

When I last wrote Android apps, the primary tools were Java and XML. Kotlin was just beginning to receive support, and cross-platform solutions like React Native and Flutter were in their infancy. Now, the XML and Java approach to building Android apps is somewhat outdated, and the alternatives have matured significantly, offering compelling use cases.

Flutter appears to be a quick way to get started, with user-friendly tooling and cross-platform capabilities, provided you are willing to learn Dart. It has a very active and growing developer community and an impressive portfolio of apps built using it. React Native also offers cross-platform advantages, with the added benefit of allowing you to write code in JavaScript and TypeScript. However, I decided to proceed with Kotlin as it seems best suited for me for the following reasons.

### Kotlin Language Capabalities
One of the main reason is that I would like to learn the Kotlin programming language itself. I am particularly interested in learning Kotlin because of its modern and efficient design. Kotlin offers a concise way to write readable code with significantly less boilerplate compared to Java. An appealing features of Kotlin is its null safety, which helps prevent the common null pointer exceptions prevalent in Java.

Kotlin's language features, such as coroutines and flows, make writing asynchronous code much more manageable and less error-prone. These tools allow for the creation of asynchronous programs that are easy to read and maintain.

Additionally, Kotlin Multiplatform, although still in its early stages, promises to be a powerful tool for developing cross-platform applications. This capability could be highly beneficial in the future, allowing developers to share code across multiple platforms seamlessly.

Moreover, Kotlinâ€™s compatibility with Java means that I can continue to use the Java libraries I am familiar with when needed, ensuring a smooth transition and integration into existing projects.    

### Cross Platform is Not Quite Native
I do not want to develope cross platform apps at this point. Thus the additional tooling and larger app sizes does not make much sense. I am also planning to update my web development knowledge and might give react native a shot at that point.
